# Product Context: Indian Cards Against Humanity

## Problem Solved

- **Lack of Culturally Relevant Party Games:** Standard party games like Cards Against Humanity often lack references and humor specific to the Indian context, making them less relatable or engaging for Indian audiences.
- **Need for Digital Social Connection:** Provides a fun, interactive way for friends, family, and even strangers across India (and the diaspora) to connect and play together online, especially when physical gatherings aren't possible.
- **Desire for Humorous & Edgy Entertainment:** Caters to an audience looking for witty, sometimes controversial, and distinctly Indian humor in a game format.

## How It Should Work (User Experience)

- **Easy Setup & Customization:** Users should quickly create/join games. Hosts should be able to customize key rules like game duration (via dealer turns per player).
- **Unique Gameplay Loop:**
  - Experience the rotating "dealer" role, adding a dynamic similar to poker.
  - Understand the goal of collecting black prompt cards, not just winning rounds.
  - Easily submit one or two answer cards as required by the prompt.
  - Enjoy the dealer reading out the combined prompt/answer before choosing a winner.
- **Engaging Indian Content:** The cards remain central, needing to be funny and culturally relevant.
- **Variety and Replayability:**
  - Custom game settings (duration) provide variability.
  - (Paid Feature) Ability for hosts to upload custom JSON card decks offers significant replayability and personalization.
  - (Future) AI commentary adds unpredictable fun.
  - (Future) Other special mechanics (Chai Break, etc.) can add layers (_priority to be reviewed_).
- **Flexible Play Styles:** The "Family Filter" option remains relevant for adapting content.
- **Seamless Social Interaction:** Friends lists, invites, chat remain important.
- **Mobile First:** UI/UX optimization for mobile is crucial.
- **Accessible:** Maintain accessibility standards.

## Target Audience

- Young adults and adults in India and the Indian diaspora.
- Groups of friends looking for unique, customizable online party games.
- Individuals seeking humorous, culturally relevant entertainment with a twist on familiar concepts.
