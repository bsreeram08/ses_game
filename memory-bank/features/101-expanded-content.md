# Feature Overview: 101 - Expanded Card Content

## Goal

Expand the variety and replayability of the game by introducing additional official card packs, enabling community contributions, and allowing hosts to upload their own custom card sets.

## Core Requirements (Phase 2+)

- **Additional Official Card Packs:**
  - Create and add new sets of prompt and answer cards based on themes (e.g., Regional specific, Pop culture, Political satire, Festivals & traditions).
  - Provide a mechanism for users/hosts to select which official packs are active in a game (likely during game creation).
- **Custom Card Upload (Paid Feature):**
  - Allow game hosts (potentially as a premium feature) to upload their own custom set of prompt and answer cards.
  - Define a specific JSON format for custom card uploads.
  - Implement validation for uploaded JSON files (structure, content limits).
  - Store or reference these custom sets for use in games created by that host.
- **Community Submitted Cards (Future - Phase 2/3):**
  - Develop a system for users to submit new card ideas (prompts/answers).
  - Implement a moderation workflow to review and approve community submissions.
  - Incorporate approved community cards into special packs or the main deck.
