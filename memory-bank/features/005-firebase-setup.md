# Feature Overview: 005 - Firebase Setup & Integration (MVP)

## Goal

Set up the necessary Firebase project, configure required services (Auth, Firestore, RTDB, Functions), establish initial security rules, and integrate the Firebase SDK into the Next.js application.

## Core Requirements (MVP)

- **Firebase Project:** Create or confirm the Firebase project to be used for development/production.
- **Service Configuration:** Enable and configure:
  - Firebase Authentication (Email/Password, Google, Facebook providers).
  - Firestore Database (Native mode).
  - Realtime Database.
  - Cloud Functions (Node.js environment).
- **SDK Integration:**
  - Install the Firebase client SDK (`firebase`).
  - Create a Firebase initialization file (`src/lib/firebase.ts` or similar) with project configuration credentials.
  - Initialize Firebase app instance.
  - Export necessary Firebase service instances (auth, db, rtdb).
- **Firestore Security Rules:** Implement basic security rules allowing authenticated users read/write access to their own data and game data as needed for MVP (referencing `rules.md` examples).
- **Realtime Database Rules:** Implement basic rules, likely allowing authenticated users read/write access to relevant game state paths.
- **(Optional) Firebase Emulators:** Set up local Firebase emulators for offline development and testing (Auth, Firestore, RTDB, Functions).
