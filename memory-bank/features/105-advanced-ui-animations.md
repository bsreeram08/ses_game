# Feature Overview: 105 - Advanced UI & Animations

## Goal

Enhance the visual appeal and user experience of the game by implementing creative and fluid animations for key gameplay actions and polishing the UI for card presentation and judging.

## Core Requirements (Phase 2)

- **Card Shuffling Animation:** Implement a visually engaging animation when the decks are shuffled (e.g., at game start, potentially during Chai Break).
- **Card Distribution Animation:** Animate the dealing of cards from the deck to player hands.
- **Card Selection Animation:** Provide clear visual feedback and potentially a subtle animation when a player selects a card from their hand for submission.
- **Card Presentation Animation ("Card Chazar"):**
  - Animate the reveal of submitted answer cards to the judge.
  - Design a polished and intuitive UI layout for the judge to view submitted cards against the prompt card.
  - Implement an animation for highlighting/selecting the winning card.
- **Performance:** Ensure animations are smooth and performant across target devices, potentially using libraries like Framer Motion or CSS transitions/animations effectively.
