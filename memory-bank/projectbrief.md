# Project Brief: Indian Cards Against Humanity

## Core Goal

To create a unique, digital, mobile-responsive card game inspired by "Cards Against Humanity" but with a distinct Indian flavor and a custom ruleset. The game involves players responding to prompts with answer cards, judged by a rotating "dealer," with the goal of collecting the most prompt cards. It should be playable online with friends or strangers, supporting 3-10 players.

## Key Objectives

1.  **Develop Custom Core Gameplay:** Implement the unique ruleset:
    - Rotating dealer role (each player gets turns as dealer).
    - Players submit 1 or 2 answer cards based on prompt requirements.
    - Dealer reads submissions and selects the best one.
    - Winner collects the black prompt card.
    - Player with the most black cards at the end wins.
    - Game duration based on dealer turns per player (customizable).
2.  **Incorporate Indian Flavor:** Create unique card content (prompts and answers) reflecting Indian culture, politics, pop culture, and daily life.
3.  **Implement Customization & Advanced Features:**
    - Allow game hosts to customize game duration/dealer turns.
    - (Paid Feature) Enable hosts to upload custom card sets via JSON.
    - (Future) Integrate AI for commentary/prompts.
    - (Future) Implement other planned special mechanics (Chai Break, Jugaad, etc. - _re-evaluate priority based on new core rules_).
4.  **Build a Scalable Platform:** Utilize Firebase and Next.js for a robust and scalable backend and frontend.
5.  **Phased Rollout:** Follow a structured plan (MVP, Enhanced Features, Monetization/Scaling) adapting to the new ruleset.
6.  **User Authentication & Social Features:** Allow users to create accounts, manage profiles, add friends, and interact within the game.
7.  **Accessibility & Responsiveness:** Ensure the game is playable across modern browsers and devices, adhering to accessibility standards.
