# Progress: Samudhayam Ethirkum Attai

## Current Status

- **Phase:** Active Development - Core Gameplay Implementation
- **Overall:** The application has progressed significantly with working user authentication, game creation, and core gameplay. Recently implemented error tracking system and game state recovery mechanisms to improve reliability.
- **Focus:** Enhancing game stability, improving game state transitions, and ensuring proper access to game rounds.

## What Works

- **User Authentication (001)**: Email/password, social login, anonymous login with Indian-themed names, account conversion
- **Game Creation & Lobby (002)**: Create game, invite link, waiting room, custom duration/turns
- **Core Gameplay (003)**: 
  - Basic gameplay flow, card selection, scoring
  - Game start process and round creation
  - Round data synchronization with real-time round tracking
  - Card deck selection and distribution of cards
- **Firebase Setup & Integration (005)**: 
  - Project config, SDK integration
  - Enhanced security rules for games, rounds, and cards collections
  - Transaction support for complex game state changes
- **Error Tracking & Game Fixes (007)**: 
  - Comprehensive error tracking with Firebase Analytics
  - Toast notifications for improved error UX
  - Game state recovery mechanisms including manual round loading
  - Player readiness system

## What's Left to Build (High-Level based on revised plan)

- **Phase 1: MVP (Revised)**
  - User Authentication (001)
  - Game Creation & Lobby (Custom Settings) (002)
  - Core Gameplay (Custom Rules: Rotating Dealer, Collect Black Cards) (003)
  - Basic UI/UX (004)
  - Firebase Setup & Integration (005)
  - Core Dependencies Setup (006)
- **Phase 2: Enhanced Features**

  - Advanced Game Modes (Special Rounds - _Re-evaluate_, Tournament, Team Play) (102)
  - Social Features (103)
  - Progression System (104)
  - Advanced UI & Animations (105)
  - AI Commentary (106)
- **Phase 3: Monetization & Scaling**
  - Premium Features (Ad-free, Customization, Exclusive Content) (201)
  - Analytics & Improvements (202)
  - Localization (203)
  - Community Building (204)
- **Technical Foundations:**
  - Detailed Feature Plans (`memory-bank/feature-plans/`) for all MVP features.
  - Firebase Setup (Actual configuration, detailed rules).
  - Next.js Project Implementation (Code).
  - Dependency Implementation.

## Known Issues

- **Game Stability**:
  - Game state synchronization may still need optimization for larger player counts
  - Game error recovery should be more automated with fewer user interactions needed
  - More comprehensive logging needed to catch edge cases

## Recent Fixes

- **Game Starting Process**:
  - Fixed enum mismatch between `RoundPhase.SUBMISSION` and the correct value `RoundPhase.SUBMITTING`
  - Enhanced Firestore security rules for rounds subcollection to properly support transactions
  - Implemented manual round data loading functionality when rounds are missing
  - Added better error handling and user feedback during game start process

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Initial Decision:** Adopt the comprehensive plan outlined in `features.md` as the roadmap.
- **[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Initial Decision:** Establish a Memory Bank system for documentation and context persistence.
- **[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Initial Decision:** Utilize Next.js, Firebase (Auth, Firestore, RTDB, Functions), TypeScript, and shadcn/ui as the core technology stack.
- **[2025-05-04 17:00:19] - Major Decision:** Adopted a custom ruleset (rotating dealer, collect black cards, custom duration/cards, AI feature) distinct from the original inspiration, requiring updates to plans and features. (See `decisionLog.md`).
