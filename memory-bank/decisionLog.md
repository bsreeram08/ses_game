**Decision [2025-05-04 17:00:19]:** Adopt a custom ruleset distinct from the original game inspiration.
**Rationale:** To create a unique game experience, avoid potential licensing issues, and incorporate specific mechanics like rotating dealers, collecting black cards for points, customizable game duration/turns, custom card uploads (paid), and AI commentary.
**Implementation Details:** Requires significant updates to core gameplay logic (Feature 003), game creation settings (Feature 002), card content handling (Feature 101), and addition of a new AI feature (Feature 106). Core documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`) and feature plans need revision.
